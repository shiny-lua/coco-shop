				"title": "Blockchain Is Often Referred To As",
				"description1": "Blockchain is often referred to as the second internet and is a groundbreaking technology that solves the challenges faced by traditional systems. By utilizing blockchain, it becomes possible to prevent data tampering while perpetually preserving various activity histories.",
				"description2": "This technology is used in the operation of cryptocurrencies (tokens) such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
				"description3": "In this project, we focus on the sustainability of blockchain itself and aim to create a user-participatory sustainable economic zone by implementing it for activities and projects for the natural environment, as well as for idol activities."

				"title": "In This Project, We Aim To Contribute",
				"description1": "In this project, we aim to contribute to the expansion of activities related to the development of new technologies and the conservation of existing resources.",
				"description2": "Reducing CO2 emissions is important, but at the same time, forest conservation activities that absorb CO2 are crucial, and we will focus on afforestation efforts.",
				"description3": "Furthermore, we will advance collaboration with projects working on the development of new-generation batteries (accumulators) that improve energy efficiency.",
				"description4": "In addition, we will promote collaboration and support with organizations involved in environmental protection, such as biomass power generation for creating clean energy, through our platform."

				"description2": "Idols are icons with significant social influence and serve as a source of daily comfort for their fans.",
				"description3": "Utilizing their substantial social influence, we will collaborate and promote eco-friendly activities. Moreover, regardless of how much spotlight an idol may receive, the current reality is that they gradually fade out over time.",
				"description4": "Our aim is to create a sustainable world in the idol industry, targeting idols from their early days to those who have graduated, ensuring longevity and continued relevance."
